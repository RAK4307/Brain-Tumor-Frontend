                  <p>
                    Brain tumors represent a significant global health challenge. Annually, hundreds of thousands of new cases are diagnosed worldwide. In India, the incidence is also substantial, making it a critical area for healthcare focus. The bar chart illustrates the estimated number of new cases reported annually, comparing the figures for India with the global total. This data highlights the scale of the issue and the need for widespread access to advanced diagnostic tools.

                  <p>
                    The prognosis for brain tumor patients has been steadily improving due to advancements in surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However, outcomes vary significantly based on the tumor's type, grade, and location. The pie chart provides a general overview of treatment success rates, categorizing outcomes into "Successfully Treated" and "Non-Curable/Fatal." This visualization underscores the ongoing battle against the disease and the importance of continued research into more effective treatments.
